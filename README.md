## Goals
- In the development process, the intention was to make the app look and work like the in-game skill tree as much as possible
- This meant using assets and images directly from Blizzard to ensure authenticity
- The UI design and functionality were based on the actual in-game skill tree mechanics to provide an accurate representation of the system
- The aim was to create an immersive experience that closely resembles the actual game, so that users can get a feel for how their builds will look and work in the game
